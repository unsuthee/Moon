I am a Phd student at Santa Clara University advised by Prof. Yi Fang . My research interests are document analysis, Bayesian models, Deep Generative models with applications to information retrieval and recommendation systems. When I am not doing research, I have created Thai-subtitles for more than 120 minutes of Khan academy video lectures.
